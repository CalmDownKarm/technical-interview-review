# Technical Interview Review Cheat Sheets

This repo is for all UIUC ECE and CS students to come together and create review sheets as we prepare for technical interviews. Many of us have taken a core set of important classes (especially CS 225), and want a place to quickly glance at major topics from these classes (data structures, big O, etc).

This is meant to be done collectively, so feel free to fork the repo, make any additions or changes, and create a pull request!

Note: Since this is going to be viewed on GitHub (for now, at least), we're going to be using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). If you're going to be making edits, please familiarize yourself with Markdown first!

Note: If you want to put images in your document, put them in the `assets` folder, and use the following format to link to it: `https://raw.github.com/ieee-uiuc/technical-interview-review/master/asset/<image-file>`.


Note: We're starting out with ECE and CS classes, but this can certainly expand to other topics as well!
